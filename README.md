Generate a random 12 Track album using the Spotify API

**Project Brief**

Using the Spotify API generate a random 12 track album.

**Technologies**

For this project I used the following technologies:
HTML5
CSS
JavaScript
React
JSON
Git
GitHub
Pupteer

Trello

I used Trello to keep track of what needed to be done. This helped break up the SPA(Single Page Application) into more manageable tasks

Challenges and Problems

Spotify uses UUID’s for each song. as you can imagine its pretty hard to generate a random UUID that will  match a song within the collection of music they have on offer. I had to find an alternative method to get a single random song. I learnt how to use puppeteer and web scraped some of Spotifys playlist names. I could then use these names within Spotifys API

Wins

I didn’t have a design in mind, But I wanted to see how I would cope using a design created by someone else. As I was working alone on this project I went to the Spotify website and saw a hero section which could work well within this project. I recreated the styling using CSS. 

Future Features

Email/SMS  or Social Media integration so uses can share with other people and get them involved.

Local Storage to store the playlist on the browser until a new one is generated.
