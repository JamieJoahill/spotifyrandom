Uses the Spotify API to generate a random 12 track album

I wanted to use the data the spotify api has to generate a random 12 track album. I have run into a road block in the project because spotify uses a uuid for
each track, therefore trying to generate a uuid that matches the same track as a spotify track will be an enormous task in itself. 

I have decided it would be best to use another music api to generate a track and then once I have that data I can then search spotifies api for that song.
